Most programmers face challenges when estimating project timelines. Time estimation in software development can be notoriously difficult. The points outlined here offer insights and strategies for addressing this challenge.

1. **Planning:**
   All programming projects should start with clear and well-defined planning. This includes breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units, understanding the requirements thoroughly, and estimating the effort required for each task. 
   This initial planning stage helps set expectations for the project's timeline and scope.
   And, when you begin your concrete development--you realize, this is not what you thought it would be.

2. **Execution:**
   Living up to the plan is crucial. Developers should follow the outlined tasks, adhere to time estimates, and avoid scope creep. Staying disciplined in executing the plan can contribute to better project management and more accurate estimations.

3. **Time Tracking and Evaluation:**
   Time tracking is an essential tool for understanding how much time is actually spent on various tasks. By tracking time, programmers can identify discrepancies between their estimates and the actual time taken. This information provides a valuable learning opportunity and can lead to improved future estimations.

Addressing the resistance to estimating project time is crucial, and your proposed steps provide a comprehensive approach to managing this issue. Incorporating real-world examples, case studies, or personal experiences could enhance the article's relatability and usefulness to readers. Additionally, exploring common reasons behind resistance to time estimation (such as optimism bias, uncertainty, and fear of commitment) and providing strategies to overcome these challenges could further enrich the content.

Remember to provide actionable tips, tools, or methodologies for effective time tracking, execution, and evaluation. The goal is to empower programmers with practical solutions that they can implement in their workflow.

Lastly, consider discussing the benefits of accurate time estimation, such as improved project planning, better resource allocation, and enhanced communication with stakeholders.
