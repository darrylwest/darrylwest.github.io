            <ul>
                <li>
                    People who reside in rural areas.  Currently internet coverage is spotty in remote areas of the U.S.  Especially in native reserves that lack Cell Phone towers.
                </li>
                <li>Inner city financially challenged people.  Internet coverage in urban areas is usually strong, but if you don’t have the means to purchase a computer or smart phone, you can’t benefit from coverage. 
                </li>
                <li>Seniors (over 70 yo) aren’t as familiar with digital communications, devices or computers as younger generations.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rural individuals and communities would benefit greatly from internet access to provide job opportunities, on-line schooling, communication with other remote communities that share the same challenges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Urban people would benefit by have access to job opportunities, on-line training, communication with other family / friends even in different cities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seniors would benefit by having access to on-line training, government services (social security, medicare, etc), direct connection to health facilities, connection with family members.  The downside is that seniors are often targets of internet scammers and can fall prey to realistic sounding offers that turn out bad and cause financial harm.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Large ISPs: Xfinity/Comcast, Century Link, T-Home Internet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Medium Size ISPs: Viasat, HughesNet, Ziply, Astound, Star Touch

            <ul>
                <li>
                    All ISPs benefit from more subscribers.  But, the largest ISPs are not interested in small subscribers--at least in the long run.  They will attract new users with low cost at first but silently increase the charges after a short time. Good for them but bad for the consumer, especially the new internet adopters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Medium sized ISPs are probably the best for low-income subscribers.  Their access times are not as speedy but they seem to be more open and honest about their charges.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The benefits of additional internet connections has mixed affects on schools, libraries and even other public outlets like coffee shops that offer free internet connection.  The mix is that as more people recognize the positive impact of being on-line, the more they selectively choose to be.  If it's a school, then a student might select an institution that has wide area free access over another that might have spotty or no access.  For libraries, the cost of supporting access (and computers) can easily break there budgets.  For businesses, it is usually a benefit because the relatively low cost of internet access is usually passed on to the consumer (witness the $6 latte or $4 hot chocolate).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The negative affects of wider access to the internet for schools and libraries is the additional costs to support the required infrastructures.  Wifi coverage with multiple repeaters is often required--especially for devices that can't easily directly connect to a hard-wired connection (like the new mac-books).
