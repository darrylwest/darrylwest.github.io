            <ul>
                <li>
                    People who reside in rural areas.  Currently internet coverage is spotty in remote areas of the U.S.  Especially in native reserves that lack Cell Phone towers.
                </li>
                <li>Inner city financially challenged people.  Internet coverage in urban areas is usually strong, but if you don’t have the means to purchase a computer or smart phone, you can’t benefit from coverage. 
                </li>
                <li>Seniors (over 70 yo) aren’t as familiar with digital communications, devices or computers as younger generations.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rural individuals and communities would benefit greatly from internet access to provide job opportunities, on-line schooling, communication with other remote communities that share the same challenges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Urban people would benefit by have access to job opportunities, on-line training, communication with other family / friends even in different cities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seniors would benefit by having access to on-line training, government services (social security, medicare, etc), direct connection to health facilities, connection with family members.  The downside is that seniors are often targets of internet scammers and can fall prey to realistic sounding offers that turn out bad and cause financial harm.
