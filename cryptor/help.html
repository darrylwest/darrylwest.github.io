        <h1>Cryptor Application Help</h1>

        <h2>What does this thing do?</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>
            The Cryptor app is a desktop/laptop browser application that takes a text message you enter and encrypts it
            based on your _case-sensitive_ passphrase.
            It then lets you download the result to your personal device (desktop or laptop) as an HTML file embedded
            with the encrypted data.
            From there, you can double-click the downloaded file to render it in a browser and decrypt the text using
            the same passphrase.
        </p>

        <p>
            The typical use case is securly saving a list of hard to remember passwords.
        </p>

        <p>
            The file cannot be decrypted without the passphrase, so it's important to create a phrase that is long
            enough to be difficult to guess, and easy to remember.
        <p>

        <h2>Is it secure?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a browser application, with no personal data, text, or passphrase going to the server or over the
            wire.
            The encrypted file is only downloaded to your personal device, typically in your downloads folder.
            The passphrase never leaves your browser and is not stored in cookies, local storage, etc.
            <em>As with all internet applications that prompt for a password or passphrase, you should always check the
                address bar to verify the domain.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Since the passphrase is not sent over the wire and not stored anywhere, it's important to know 
            that<em>there is no way to recover it.</em>  So, use a phase that you can remember.
        </p>

        <h2>Pass Phrase Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>he who is brave is free. no?</li>
            <li>you can totally do this.</li>
            <li>try a slow count to 10, then speak.</li>
            <li>choose one thing and go all in. or not.</li>
            <li>I can, and I Will. Smith.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter or copy/paste your message, list of passwords, etc to the message box</li>
            <li>Enter your passphrase</li>
            <li>Click the <em>Encrypt Message</em> button</li>
            <li>Click the <em>Download</em> link</li>
            <li>Open the downloaded file, enter your passphrase and verity the plain text content</li>
            <li>(Optional) Move the file to your desktop or other location with an alternate name.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Don't forget to close the browser page after verifying the encryption, especially if you are using this in a
            public setting, like when you have your laptop at a caf√©.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can then just leave the file in your downloads folder, or move it to an alternate, or even your desk
            top.
            Without the passphrase, it can't be decrypted. And, the passphrase never gets shared to any browser or other
            application.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Access and Decrypt your download?</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>
            To access your secrets file, navigate to the file using Finder and double-click it.
            Once the file opens, enter the passphrase and click the Decrypt button. The decrypted text will appear, and
            the password field and button will disappear.
            To hide the plaintext, close or refresh the browser page.
            The page will automatically time out and close after 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>Important Things to Concider</h2>
        <audio controls>

        </audio>

        <h2>Updating Existing File</h2>
        <p>
            You can update an existing file by first decrpting it, then copy/past to the a new application session.
            Make changes to the text, then re-encrypt and download the new file.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the number in filename?</h2>
        <p>
            The filename <em>secret-####.html</em> is created in the browser using the current date as a timestamp.
            The timestamp is from javascript's <em>Date.getTime()</em> method.
        </p>

        <h2>What happens when I click Encrpt Message Button?</h2>
        <p>
            The passphrase is used to encrypt the message right in the browser (not a server action).
            The resulting cipher text is in the page and appended to the secrets file when you click the download link.
        </p>

        <h2>Browser Support</h2>
        <p>This application has been tested on the following Mac OS/OSX (Intel and ARM) desktop browsers...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge (for Mac)</li>
            <li>Firefox (mac and linux)</li>
            <li>Duck Duck Go</li>
            <li>Arc Browser</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any browser that uses the latest version (as of 2023) of WebKit should work.</p>
        <p><em>Note that this works on desktop/laptop machines but isn't recommended for tables or phones.</em>

            <h2>Need more security from Internet Attacks?</h2>
            <p>
                A more secure use of the Cryptor Application is to download the source code and run it on your own
                machine.
                The requirement is that you need to run an https (secure sockets) server.
                I use <a href="https://docs.rs/crate/miniserve/latest">miniserve</a> using the following command:
            </p>
            <code>miniserve -p 2024 --index index.html --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem</code>
            <p>
                You can install miniserve on an OSX/mac with brew.
            </p>

    <!-- <h2>Screen Shots</h2> -->
    <h2>Beta Version</h2>
    <p><em>This application is currently in beta testing with a number of improvements planned prior to formal release.
            Planned improvements are to the user interface, adding themes, etc; but not the encryption logic. So it's
            safe to use, but it's look my change before release.</em></p>
