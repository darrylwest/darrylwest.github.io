        <h1>Cryptor Application Help</h1>

        <h2>What does this application do?</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>
            The Cryptor app is a desktop/laptop browser application that encrypts a text message you enter using a
            case-sensitive passphrase. It allows you to download the encrypted result as an HTML file embedded with
            the encrypted data. You can then double-click the downloaded file to open it in a browser and decrypt the 
            text using the same passphrase.
        </p>

        <p>
            The typical use case is securely saving a list of hard-to-remember passwords.
        </p>

        <p>
            The file cannot be decrypted without the passphrase, so it's essential to create a passphrase that is 
            both difficult to guess and easy to remember.
        </p>

        <h2>Is it secure?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a browser-based application. No personal data, text, or passphrase is sent to a server or over the 
            internet. The encrypted file is downloaded only to your personal device, typically in your downloads folder. 
            The passphrase never leaves your browser and is not stored in cookies, local storage, or other locations.
            <em>As with any internet application prompting for a password or passphrase, always verify the domain in 
            the address bar.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the passphrase is not transmitted or stored, <em>there is no way to recover it if lost.</em> 
            Choose a phrase you can remember.
        </p>

        <h2>Passphrase Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>He who is brave is free. No?</li>
            <li>You can totally do this.</li>
            <li>Try a slow count to 10, then speak.</li>
            <li>Choose one thing and go all in. Or not.</li>
            <li>I can, and I will. Smith.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter or copy/paste your message, list of passwords, etc., into the message box.</li>
            <li>Enter your passphrase.</li>
            <li>Click the <em>Encrypt Message</em> button.</li>
            <li>Click the <em>Download</em> link.</li>
            <li>Open the downloaded file, enter your passphrase, and verify the plain text content.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Move the file to another location with an alternate name.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Close the browser page after verifying the encryption, especially in public settings like a caf√©.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can leave the file in your downloads folder, move it to another location, or even your desktop. Without 
            the passphrase, it cannot be decrypted.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Access and Decrypt Your Download?</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>
            To access your secrets file, navigate to the file in Finder and double-click it. Once open, enter the 
            passphrase and click the Decrypt button. The decrypted text will appear, and the password field and button 
            will disappear. To hide the plaintext, close or refresh the browser page. The page will automatically 
            time out and close after 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h2>Important Things to Consider</h2>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="help-4.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h2>Updating an Existing File</h2>
        <p>
            You can update an existing file by first decrypting it, then copying and pasting the content into a new 
            application session. Make changes to the text, re-encrypt it, and download the updated file.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Number in the Filename?</h2>
        <p>
            The filename <em>secret-####.html</em> is generated in the browser using the current date as a timestamp 
            from JavaScript's <em>Date.getTime()</em> method.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happens When I Click the Encrypt Message Button?</h2>
        <p>
            The passphrase is used to encrypt the message directly in the browser (not on a server). The resulting 
            ciphertext is embedded in the page and appended to the secrets file when you click the download link.
        </p>

        <h2>Browser Support</h2>
        <p>This application has been tested on the following Mac OS/OSX (Intel and ARM) desktop browsers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge (for Mac)</li>
            <li>Firefox (Mac and Linux)</li>
            <li>DuckDuckGo</li>
            <li>Arc Browser</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any browser using the latest version (as of 2023) of WebKit should work.</p>
        <p><em>Note: This application is designed for desktop/laptop machines and is not recommended for tablets or phones.</em></p>

        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>
            Most of the logic for this app is based on a library under the 
            <a href="https://tlo.mit.edu/understand-ip/exploring-mit-open-source-license-comprehensive-guide">MIT license</a>, 
            called <a href="https://github.com/mprimi/portable-secret">portable-secret</a>, written by Marco Primi.

    <h2>Beta Version</h2>
    <p><em>This application is currently in beta testing, with planned improvements to the user interface, themes, etc., but not to the encryption logic. While safe to use, its appearance may change before release.</em></p>
