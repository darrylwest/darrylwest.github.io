Charging Problem:

My ipad pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation stopped responding to it's type-c charger.
I have tried multiple connectors (all have worked in the past) but the charging
indicator never turns on.   I have also verified power to the cable via a 
separate device.

Steps tried:

1. Swapped cables multiple times
2. Rebooted ipad
3. used air to clean port
4. finally found a combination that worked but it's intermittent 
5. apple care: Mobile Kangaroo - 133 Berkeley Square 102275718603

Questions:

1. are there any iPads, minis, etc that use induction charging?
2. how do I clean the usb port?
